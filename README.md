# buckets

This is a Google App Script library that works with a google sheets spread sheet to do budgeting. It uses the buckets/money bags methodology. Note this has been around for 40 odd years  at least with minor variations under different names. An Australian book that outlines it is the "Bare Foot Investor". The concept is to estimate how much you will spend over time on a category or bucket and then save the equivalent into that bucket each pay cycle.
